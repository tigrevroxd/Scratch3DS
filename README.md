# Scratch3Ds

Hi! I don’t know much about programming yet, but I want to share this idea:

We can convert Scratch games to HTML using TurboWarp.
The goal is to create a tool or pipeline that converts these HTML games into CIA files (installable apps) for the Nintendo 3DS.
Once we have the CIA file, the game can run natively on the 3DS.

Why this is cool.

1.- It would let people play tons of Scratch games on a real portable console.
2.- It could bring new life to the 3DS scene with lots of homebrew games.
3.- It would be an awesome project for developers interested in homebrew and Scratch.

If you know programming and want to collaborate, you can help build the converter tool.
Testing exported HTML Scratch games.
Designing UI/UX for the launcher on 3DS.

Or anything else!

I’m sharing this to see if anyone wants to join and make it real. I can’t program this myself yet.
